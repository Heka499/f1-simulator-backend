# üèéÔ∏è Formula 1 Simulator ‚Äî Backend (Spring Boot)

This is the backend portion of a Formula 1 simulation project built with Java and Spring Boot. It simulates Formula 1 races based on driver, car, and team performance and provides REST API endpoints for managing championships and running simulations.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Maven**
- **REST API**
- No database or frontend integration yet (planned)

## ‚úÖ Current Features (v0.2)

### Championship Management
- Create a championship for a specific year with predefined drivers, teams, cars, and race schedules.
- Retrieve championship standings (drivers and teams) sorted by points.

### Race Simulation
- Simulate races one at a time or all races in a championship.
- Race results are determined by a performance score combining:
  - `Car`: speed, reliability, handling
  - `Driver`: skill, consistency
  - Random factor for unpredictability.
- Update driver and team standings after each race.
- Race results are returned in finishing order.

### REST API Endpoints
- **POST `/championship/create`**: Create a championship for a given year.
- **POST `/championship/{year}/next`**: Simulate the next race in the championship.
- **GET `/championship/{year}/standings`**: Retrieve driver and team standings for a championship year.
